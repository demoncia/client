- Fixed a spelling error in the "Title Pack: Animal Lover" item.<br>

- All existing player-castable pet block buffs have had damage caps added to them.  These values should easily exceed damage from group content of the appropriate eras: <br>

<br>
<br>
*** Achievements ***<br>
<br>

- Added check boxes to filter mercenaries and pets in the Tracking Window that tie in to the existing All, Group or None filters.<br>
- Converted all of the dragitem TGA files to the DDS format to reduce memory requirements.  If you maintain a UI that uses custom images, we suggest you define these images in another XML file and add the name of that file to EQUI.xml instead of adding them directly to EQUI_Animations.xml.<br>
- Corrected many icons that previously bled into each other.<br>
- Added many more usable icons to the game.<br>
- Converted the location of where we define a window as "Escapable" from the code to the XML for that window. There is now a new XML tag that we recognize "Escapable". By default, all windows that don't have this tag will default to closing when pressing 'Esc'.<br>
